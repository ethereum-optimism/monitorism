# Runbook: Incident Response for Faultproof Withdrawals

## Overview

This document serves as a guide for incident response based on key metrics related to faultproof withdrawals. It describes the alerts triggered by specific conditions in the system and provides guidelines on how to handle these alerts.

FaultproofWithdrawal will monitor one L2 chain, let's say op-chain, and one L1 chain, let's say mainnet.
On L2, it will make use of [L2ToL1MessagePasser](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/L2CrossDomainMessenger.sol).
On L1, it will make use of [OptimismPortal2](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/OptimismPortal2.sol) and [FaultDisputeGame](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/FaultDisputeGame.sol).

The monitor is driven by the event [WithdrawalProvenExtension1(bytes32 indexed withdrawalHash, address indexed proofSubmitter)](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/dd2b21ce786f4c1b722bda270348597182153c8e/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/OptimismPortal2.sol#L144C5-L144C102). Every time an event is emitted, the monitor will check if this withdrawal is legitimate or a forgery attempt.

## [!IMPORTANT] Disclaimer: work in progress!

This runbook may contain references to actions and specifications not included in this repository. This runbook is provided as a guideline for incident response to the scenarios detailed herein, but some details may be redacted or missing due to the sensitive nature of the information. Where information is redacted or missing, we will try to make this clear.

The mechanism and the content of the alert is not yet published, so the name of the alerts and the contents of the alerts will depend on your own setup.

## Automated runbooks
Alongside this runbook we have some "automated" runbooks. These runbooks can be used to execute some actions either during triaging of an alert or during containment of an incident. These are basically [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), a mix of executable code and markdown, that makes them perfect for putting together instructions and "executable instructions". For setup instructions, see the [README](./automated/README.md).
Automated runbooks are in the **automated** subfolder. 
Each runbook is useful for a specific task. After starting the runbook make sure you select the one you need to execute.

## Alerts
An incident will be declared upon receiving an alert. The metrics described below trigger various alerts with differing severities. Each alert necessitates specific actions.

### faultproof-withdrawal-forgery-detected

| **Network** | **Severity Level** | **Impact**                      | **Reaction**                                             | **Actions**                                                                                                                                       |

#### Alert Description

A withdrawal event is considered a forgery if any of the following conditions apply:
1. The `withdrawalHash` is not found on L2, which can be verified by querying the [L2ToL1MessagePasser](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/L2CrossDomainMessenger.sol).
2. The [outputRoot provided](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/dd2b21ce786f4c1b722bda270348597182153c8e/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/OptimismPortal2.sol#L314C15-L314C25) does not match what is recorded in the [L2 block rootState](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/monitorism/blob/c0b2ecdf4404888e5ceccf6ad14e35c5e5c52664/op-monitorism/faultproof_withdrawals/validator/op_node_helper.go#L47).

However, there are exceptions to these conditions. The event is still considered valid if:
1. The [outputRoot provided](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/dd2b21ce786f4c1b722bda270348597182153c8e/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/OptimismPortal2.sol#L314C15-L314C25) is part of a FaultDisputeGame that has been [blacklisted](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/monitorism/blob/c0b2ecdf4404888e5ceccf6ad14e35c5e5c52664/op-monitorism/faultproof_withdrawals/validator/optimism_portal2_helper.go#L75), or where the game has ended in a [CHALLENGER_WIN](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/monitorism/blob/c0b2ecdf4404888e5ceccf6ad14e35c5e5c52664/op-monitorism/faultproof_withdrawals/monitor.go#L326).
2. The [outputRoot provided](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/dd2b21ce786f4c1b722bda270348597182153c8e/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/OptimismPortal2.sol#L314C15-L314C25) belongs to a FaultDisputeGame that is still [IN_PROGRESS](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/monitorism/blob/c0b2ecdf4404888e5ceccf6ad14e35c5e5c52664/op-monitorism/faultproof_withdrawals/monitor.go#L336). The metric [faultproof_withdrawals_invalid_proposal_withdrawals_events_count](#faultproof_withdrawals_invalid_proposal_withdrawals_events_count) is used to track such events.

#### Triage Phase

The alert (which is currently private) includes the transaction hash that triggered the event. The first step after receiving the alert is to verify whether the attack is real or if it resulted from a monitoring system error or a node issue.

To confirm the attack, begin by reviewing the event details and ensuring the conditions for the attack are met.

You can use the automated `op-monitorism/faultproof_withdrawals/runbooks/automated/triage_potential_attack_event.ipynb` runbook for this process.

and
1. Dispute Game status is CHALLENGER_WIN

#### Triage Phase

The alert ([!IMPORTANT] private alert details) includes the transaction hash that triggered the event. The first step after receiving the alert is to verify whether the attack is real or if it resulted from a monitoring system error or a node issue.

To confirm the attack, begin by reviewing the event details and ensuring the conditions for the attack are met.

You can use the automated `op-monitorism/faultproof_withdrawals/runbooks/automated/triage_potential_attack_event.ipynb` runbook for this process.

### faultproof-withdrawal-forgery-detection-stalled

| **Network** | **Severity Level** | **Impact**                                          | **Cause**                             | **Actions**                                                  |

| Mainnet     | SEV2               | - Security max reaction time is reduced<br>- May not be able to react properly to an attack | Daemon is not processing withdrawals  | - Understand the issue with the daemon<br>- If necessary, restart the service |
| Sepolia     | SEV3               | - Security max reaction time is reduced<br>- May not be able to react properly to an attack | Daemon is not processing withdrawals  | - Understand the issue with the daemon<br>- If necessary, restart the service |

#### Triage Phase

The alert ([!IMPORTANT] private alert details) includes the transaction hash that triggered the event. The first step after receiving the alert is to verify whether the monitoring is not processing event anymore and is stalled for some internal issue or the chain is in reality not processing any events since more then a day.

To confirm review the chain, see when it was last withdrawals event on it and confirm if the event happened or not within 24 hours.

You can use the automated `op-monitorism/faultproof_withdrawals/runbooks/automated/triage_detection_stalled.ipynb` runbook for this process.

##### Alert Description
This alert monitors the number of withdrawal events that are considered normal in a chain. If the number of withdrawal events goes below a specified threshold, we trigger this alert.

### faultproof-withdrawal-forgery-detection-error-unhandled

| **Network** | **Severity Level** | **Impact**                                          | **Cause**                               | **Actions**                                                                                     |
|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Mainnet     | SEV2               | - Security max reaction time is reduced<br>- May not be able to react properly to an attack | Too many errors; something may be wrong | - Find out what the error is<br>- Decide if the daemon needs to be patched or configuration changed<br>- If necessary, restart the service |
| Sepolia     | SEV3               | - Security max reaction time is reduced<br>- May not be able to react properly to an attack | Too many errors; something may be wrong | - Find out what the error is<br>- Decide if the daemon needs to be patched or configuration changed<br>- If necessary, restart the service |

##### Alert Description
This alert will be triggered when the number of connection errors goes above a specified threshold. Errors should always be very limited or absent in the monitoring. When present, it often means there is an issue with communication between the monitor and the trusted nodes used for monitoring.

#### Triage Phase

The alert ([!IMPORTANT] private alert details) includes a dashboard link where you can review logs to diagnose potential issues with the monitoring system and understand the cause of the alert.
